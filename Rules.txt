Rules:
If you are the last player alive, you get half a point every 3 seconds you can stay alive, up to 3 (18 seconds).

Killing a player with a deadly power gets you 1 point.

Contributing to a player's death but not directly killing them also gives you 1 point.
This can be done with melee attacks and sometimes the hook. Smacking a player into spikes or someone else's power will get you point. Certain powers don't kill the player directly, but can lead to deaths as well, so you still get a point.

If you combo correctly, you can get up to 2 points for a kill.

While you can still get points for killing players after you died, values will be halved.
